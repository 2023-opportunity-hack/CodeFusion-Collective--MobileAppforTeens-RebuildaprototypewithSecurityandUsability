## Introduction
SafeSpace is an app designed to allow sexual assault survivor access help discreetly. We are rebuilding the application to take advantage of React Native. This will allow us to redesign the UI to appeal more to the app's target audience and make it easier to maintain or improve the app.

## Technologies Used
Prototyping mobile app screens | Figma
Setting up development environment and routing | Expo
