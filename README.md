## Introduction
SafeSpace is an app designed to allow sexual assault survivor access help discreetly. We are rebuilding the application to take advantage of React Native. This will allow us to redesign the UI to appeal more to the app's target audience and make it easier to maintain or improve the app.

## Technologies Used
- Prototyping mobile app screens | Figma
- Setting up development environment and routing | Expo
- Front-end of app | TypeScript and React Native

## Set-up
To get the application running, you'll need to have npm. Once you clone the repository to your computer, you will need to run the following to download the node modules to run the application:
```sh
npm install
```
After that, you can start the Expo Go by running the following
```sh
npm start
```
The terminal will give directions to open the application on your preferred device (iOS, Android, or web).

## Challenges
- The first challenge was establishing development environments for different developers and different machines. Some developers were able to use iOS, but others had to resort to an Android or web environment.
- The next challenge was familiarizing ourselves with the tools for the project. The team had varying levels of experience with React Native and Expo Go. Research was necessary at the start of the project to ensure common understanding when working on the project.
